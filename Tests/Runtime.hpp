/**
 * @brief Within this test we test the runtime of our iterator, compared with the
 * std iterator. We think that your approach is slower since the std iterator is
 * more speciallized. We test different sizes: 1M, 10M, 100M, 1G. We use 
 * different Tests:
 * 1. with compiletime offset, Jumpsize
 * 2. with runtime offset, jumpsize
 * A. vector::list<float>>
 * B. list<float>
